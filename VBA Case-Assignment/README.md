# Wells Fargo Part I

#### Instructions

1. Dynamically update the headers. Extract words before the phrase "\_Wells_Fargo" to figure out the state. Do not manually type in the headers.

2. Add the state to the first column of each spreadsheet.

3. Convert the headers of each row to simply say the year.

4. Convert the numbers to currency values for all cells.

* **Hints**

  * First work on getting the correct formatting on one sheet before moving onto creating a loop that formats each sheet within your workbook.

  * If you are looking for a useful resource for finding the code to loop through all worksheets in a workbook, check out this link [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/142126/macro-to-loop-through-all-worksheets-in-a-workbook)
